# Trail Running i18n Encyclopedia

## The Vision
Trail running is more than a sport; it is a universal language spoken on mountain peaks and forest paths around the world. But while the passion is shared, the terminology is often lost in translation.

We believe that every runner, race director, and journalist deserves a shared understanding. When we say "Performance Index" or "Semi-sufficiency," it should mean the same thing in Chamonix, Colorado, and Chengdu.

**Our mission is to build the definitive, open-source, multi-lingual reference for the global trail running community.**

## What We Are Building
This is not just a dictionary. It is a living standard.

Started as a collaboration with **ITRA (International Trail Running Association)** to refine Chinese translations, this project has evolved into something bigger. We are creating a centralized knowledge base that empowers:
*   **Translators** to work with precision.
*   **Journalists** to report with accuracy.
*   **Runners** to understand the rules of the game, wherever they race.

## Designed for Community
Great things are built together. We have designed this project to be as open and accessible as the trails we run.

You don't need to be a coder to contribute. We have built a system where adding a term is as simple as filling out a form. Whether you are a veteran race director or a passionate trail runner, your knowledge is welcome here.

## Join Us
We are just getting started. The foundation is laid, but the trails are waiting to be mapped.

### For Contributors
Help us define the sport. If you know a term that's missing or a translation that could be better, jump in.
